# CS:GO Config

This is my constantly updated CS:GO autoexec config.

Put *autoexec.cfg* in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` or take what you want from it and add to your autoexec config!

After the Wild West Simulator 2015 update, *video.txt* needs to be put in `...\Steam\userdata\<Steam3 ID>\730\local\cfg`

### Launch Options

	-novid -high -threads 4 -freq 144 -refresh 144 -tickrate 128 -nojoy -nod3d9ex +exec autoexec.cfg

Enter launch options at `Steam > Library > Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (right-click) > Properties > Set Launch Options...`

### Other Settings
+ Windows Sensitivity: 6/11
+ Enhance Pointer Precision: No
+ Mouse DPI: 450
+ Mouse Polling Rate: 500hz
+ Windows 7 Aero: No - `csgo.exe Properties > Compatibility > Disable visual themes & Disable desktop composition`
+ Nvidia Maximum Pre-Rendered Frames: 1
+ I play at 1280x960 stretched (no black bars, full-screen scaling) to 1920x1080. I like the "feel", better FPS across different computers, and models are slighlty bigger. It's purely preference.
+ In-Game Audio Ouput: Headphones
